VirtualMachine
==============

This is a rewrite of Virtual Harry that is in some ways more like the relay Harry, but in others different. It has a totally new rewrite that moves everything into four modules based on the MVC concept. There are some new test programs and there is a more extensive README that can be loaded into the interfacce.
